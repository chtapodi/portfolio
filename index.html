		  <p>This project's objective was to make a small, airborne, fully autonimous drone that followed a user. Possible applications include lighting, video recording, navigation assistance, etc.</p>
		  <p>Two main problems were addressed in the design and construction of this project. The first was to create a multicopter with enough lift to carry any equipment required, and the second was to design a method for locating and following the user.</p>
		  <p>To address the issue of lift, I created a custom hexacopter, controlled by an Arduino Nano. The Nano sent signals that imitated those from a receiver. By using a prebuilt flight control system, I was able to use pre-built precisely tuned sensors
		    and flight controllers. This allowed me to focus on other components of the project, such as the tracking algorithm and hexcopter logistics.</p>
		  <p>After several iterations of the hexcopter's tracking methods, I settled on a system which utilized a camera to track the location of color patterns.</p>
		  <p>Below are several videos displaying the final design in flight. Due to safety concerns, only the rotation was autonimous. However, the other degrees of motion were all tested individually and had worked as well.</p>

		  <h4>RSSI Trilateration</h4>
		  <p>My first method for tracking was based on using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_signal_strength_indication" target="_blank">RSSI signal</a> from my phones hotspot.</p>
		  <p>To do this I used an electric imp based wireless board, and developed several methods of honing in on the phones signal. The largest issue I came across for this method was due to signal strength being logarithmic, so the values became indiscernible
		    once any real distance away from my phone.</p>
		  <p>The method I came up with involved moving in a direction until the strength changed, noting how far that was, and then turning and repeating that proccess. This gave three points along with the signal strength at each of them, which allowed
		    the calculation of what angle my phones hotspot was at in relation to it. It would then travel in this direction until the signal strength began to decrease, when it would repeat the proccess again.</p>
		  <p>Unfortunately the changes in signal strength where so slight that this method would only work over a very large area, so I had to find a better method.</p>

		  <hr class="my-4">
		  <h4>Signal Tracking</h4>
		  <p>In order to test the different methods for locating the user, I made and designed several wheeled robots, for both simplicity and safety reasons.</p>

		  <p>The first method implemented for tracking the user was simple and quite inefficient. The process involved forward motion until the signal strength began to decrease. The robot would then change direction and repeat the proccess.</p>

		  <h4>Pattern Recognition</h4>
		  <p>The method I ended up going with was based on using a camera to track a specific color pattern. This offered the benifit of being much more accurate than the other methods I had tried, though only while in direct line of sight of the pattern.
		    To increase the accuracy of the rotation I wrote a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller" target="_blank">PID</a> controller to ensure smooth rotation and efficient tracking.</p>
		  <p>A test of this is linked here</p>

		  <p>During a summer internship at Lawrence Livermore National Labratory I ported a network mapping system to a raspberry pi. This, at the cost of compute power, drastically increased the portability, allowing the system to be carried in a pocket.</p>
		  <p>I also designed and wrote a system of automation scripts to automatically run the required services and collect the data in an easy format for removal from the device.</p>
		  <p>Due to this, the whole system can now be plugged in and left until the desired data is collected, and then the data can easily be moved to a more powerful computer for analysis.</p>
		  <p>This project was presented at a formal symposium, and the presentation used is shown below.</p>

		<div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto text-left">
		  <p>When I first found out about what hydroponics is, I was immediatly fascinated by the concept. While I was doing research on the different methods of construction, I began to think of different ways the proccess could be automated.</p>
		  <p>I decided that this is would be a good project to do through the school, so several other interested students and I formed a preposal for an aquaponics research project on campus. This preposal can be viewed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kG3G_ANmYH2M6R8FW054WJIVxTd4ejG5dhmXzPSEPa8/edit?usp=sharing"
			 target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
		  <p>Unfortunately this preposal got denied as it was too costly, so I reworked the preposal into a modular system to fit various budgets, as well as some updated methods, which got approved, and can be viewed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EbEn-iob9ZzoPDQIt15XcPnm0FXwO5eUa_0MS9Y8kv8/edit?usp=sharing"
		  target="_blank">here</a>. During my sophomore year, only the tank had arrived, and while it is being proccessed for aquaponics use, we had several small scale hydroponics systems using both the DWC and Kratky methods, as can be seen in the gallery. Systems for automated fish feeding and maintenance were being designed as well.</p>
		  <p>Upon my return to Union at the begining of 2019, continuation of the project was initiated. The water for the tank was prepared and fish were chosen to get the inital bacterial cycle going. To filter the water, plants needed to immediatly be introducted to the system, even though the system was not ready for automation aspects. Lettuce and tomato plants were chosen for no particular reason besides their availability, but future crops will be selected more carefully. At the moment there are several issues with the timing of the water cycle, which is prohibiting proper aeration of the plants roots, but this will be fixed with an improved pump system. </p>
		  <p>A prototype of an automatic fish feeder was designed and 3D printed to ensure the survival of the fish over the summer, but the goal is to eventually replace this with a black soldier fly larvae hatchery. This progress can be seen in the photo gallery below.</p>

		  <p>Another student and I are resuming a project to make a submersible vehicle to locate a sunken car within a lake. As the exterior of the submarine and ballast system where designed by now graduated students, we are only able to adjust the design
		    of the interior structure, even though it is not of the best design. We have gutted and redesigned their power distribution, control system, and method of steering from on the water.</p>
		  <p>I designed the new control system around two raspberry pi’s connected by several hundred feet of ethernet. They connect via a python scripted socket, allowing control from a video game controller. The raspberry pi on the sub streams a live
		    video connection to the screen of the raspberry pi with the controller. The next step is waterproof testing in our pool.</p>

		 <p>During an internship at Lawrence Livermore National Labratory, I researched the feasibility of utilizing a single moving sensor to perform multilateration on bluetooth devices, and then map out their locations. Due to time and classification constraints, my investigation was less than thurough, and slightly rushed, but I condenced my findings into an IEEE formatted paper, which I presented at an IEEE conference, and will be published in ECAI 2019.</p>
		 <p>Development of this system presented quite a few challenges relating to the junction between realtime data collection, and analysis of the data, as well as significant insight into location and positioning algorithms. As this particular project is owned by LLNL, I am not able to continue this particular line of research, but I look forward to applying what I learned to future projects.</p>
		 <p>My paper <b><i>Single Sensor Bluetooth Multilateration from Arbitrary Locations</i></b> will be in IEEexplore when the journal is published, but the full paper is available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C-zcsJpvFkraHPQeXP53dD0v4bU-3hvO/view?usp=sharing"

		 <p>As my senior capstone, I will be working on The AF&mu;S Project, which stands for <i>Autonomous Flocking micro Submersibles</i>. The aim of this is to design and build affordable, small submersibles that have the capability to work in a swarm. Currently there are several companies making small submersibles with these capabilities, but most of them are too expensive for indevidual or undergraduate level research. The final product should present a platform on which researchers can mount their own sensors and easily utilize for whatever data collection they need.</p>
		 <p>Currently this project consists of a team of two computer engineering students, myself and <a href="http://www.jacobkaraul.com/" target="_blank">Jacob Karaul</a>, as well as two mechanical engineering students, Alex Pradhan and Sam Veith.</p>
		 <p>Along with the technological challenges that will accompany this project, which will be documented here as they unfold, there is the challenge of organizing development across a multidiscipline team. To confront this, I researched methodologies often used by startups within similar fields, several of which have been implemented into our planning and ideation sessions, a gallery of which is included below.</p>

		  <p>At the 2016 Cleantech Hackathon in Troy, NY, I and several other team members, made a wearable band that traps the majority of the body heat within the encompassed area and uses the Seebeck effect to generate small amounts of electricity,
		    which when stored up in a large capacitor, discharges with enough current to pass through a joule thief, producing enough voltage to trickle charge a LiPo battery. We used a variety of materials to get optimal temperature differential, including
		    copper cloth and thermal paste. </p>
		  <p>We had been given the Presidential Green Grant from Union College to continue development on this project, focusing on the aspects of thermal retention, power amplification, and ergonomic design, but after extensive testing we proved that
		    with current technology this system is simply too inefficient.</p>

		  <p>Another student and I designed a prototype for a mechanical device used to wirelessly unlock your door from the other side, eliminating the need for keys. A small script to host an HTML server was put on an ESP8266, which was wired up to two

		  <p>As a final project for a computer aided design and fabrication class I designed and 3D printed a human based hand that used motorized tendons to provide semi realistic movement and a similar range of motion to a human hand.</p>
		  <p>The largest design challenge was designing a system that allowed each section of the fingers to close simultaniously and still maintain a realistic range of motion for all the fingers. I designed a joint that allows the tendon to move freely
		    between the two sections and angled connections to stop the sections at the ends of rotation without severe increase in friction.</p>
